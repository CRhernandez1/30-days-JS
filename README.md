# JavaScript 30 Challenge 🚀

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos.

The goal is to build 30 projects in 30 days using **Vanilla JavaScript** (no Frameworks, no compilers, no libraries), focusing on mastering the DOM and underlying web concepts.

## 💡 Personal Notes

In this repository, I'm not just following the tutorials. I aim to refactor the original code to apply modern **ES6+ practices** and clean code principles I'm learning during my Web Development studies.
